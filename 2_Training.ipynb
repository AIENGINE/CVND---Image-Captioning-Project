    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The CNN-RNN architecture that is used to solve the image captioning problem is implemented by following a research paper as recommended by the instructor (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf)[1]. The architecture is described in Figure 3 of the paper. Following the figure the most important part of the implementation has to make two features combine in the LSTM network i-e, a feature tensor originating out of the CNN model has to be concatenated with the caption feature tensor. The CNN model or the model where image features are extracted is referred to as an encoder by the authors of the paper. And RNN (LSTM) part of the architecture is referred to as the decoder. The decoder part has the responsibility to merge input features (captions) and image features coming out of the encoder network.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the authors: CNN can be any pre-trained model that is trained on ImageNet or a large state-of-the-art network trained on a large number of classes that are common with the COCO dataset as well. However, the instructors of the course chose to go with Resnet50 with the last layer replaced with a linear untrained layer that would be trained during training sessions (transfer learning). In summary, the training of the image captioning network involves fixed parameters for Resnet50 with the last linear to match the feature embedding dimension of the LSTM inputs. The parameters of the linear part of the encoder and the entire word predicting network based on LSTM are part of the entire training network architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of the paper [1] didn't describe training hyperparameters in detail however, an important research paper was consulted (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342352783_Hyperparameter_Analysis_for_Image_Captioning)[2] that describes which training parameters matters the most during training of the CNN-RNN (CNN-LSTM) architecture. I have used 256 to embedding dimensions for words to match the image feature tensor. Changing embedding size/dim would require experimentation with appropriate image transforms as well. Furthermore, the hidden size was kept to 256 as well. As described by the authors of [2] between hidden size embedding dimensions namely 256, 512, and 1024 there were no significant differences observed in the performance of LSTM network combination with Resnet 18, 50, 101. But to keep sufficient performance and training time trade-off intact I choose 256 over any other hidden dimension size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of paper(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf)[3] used a batch size of 64, I have trained CNN-RNN with batch sizes of 128 and 32 both were showing similar results after 1 epoch. So, I skipped to 128 batch size because it requires a complete day to train and for the purpose of the task a batch size of 32 provides right kind of trade-off between time to train, local machine and provided cloud machine computational requirements and sufficient accuracy. On local machine with Quadro P2000 I was able to train the network in 4 hours approximately with a batch size of 32 and 3-Epochs. On provided cloud environment with K80 Tesla the network took almost 12 hours to train. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was observed that network trained after 3rd epoch resulted in better approximation and more accurate results in terms of sentences explaining the pictures, but caching early lowest-scored loss function model in epoch 1 performed well on good sentence structure albeit quite less accurate as output by the network. As an example during Epoch-1 a model with a loss of less than 2.2 was saved and it performed somewhat similar in sentence structure as the fully trained model. But with more mistakes on the test set in describing the picture. I didn't explore validation loss individually but it would be worth the investigation if early stopping models are similar performant then the fully trained network. The last important parameter is vocabulary size which in my opinion default/provided size of 5 as described by the authors of the paper[1] is sufficient to provide enough vocabulary to the network while keeping the dataset (vocabulary size) manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** As original Resnet(https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) was trained on 224x224 therefore parameters mentioned by the instructor in image caption project notebooks including Normalize and Random crop, flip are recommended way to get most appropriate results out of pre-trained network. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** As described in the answer to question 1, trainable parameters includes the last layer of encoder-CNN and all trainable parameters on the decoder-RNN side (weights and biases of LSTM and Linear fully-connected layer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** According to the paper[1] fixed learning and no-momentum SGD optimizer was used by the author to train the CNN-RNN model. However, author of paper[2] and [3] also suggested by the instructor used Adam and it was also selected because it has momentum properties to find best global minimum."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
